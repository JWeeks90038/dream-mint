## üèÅ **My Recommendation for Ultra-Low Budget**

**Start with 0.1 SOL ($16.21)**

‚úÖ **Covers 10 NFT mints** - enough to prove concept  
‚úÖ **Immediate profitability** - $26.28 profit after 10 sales  
‚úÖ **Self-funding growth** - use profits to expand  
‚úÖ **Minimal risk** - lose maximum $16.21  
‚úÖ **Quick payback** - recover investment with 6 NFTs  

### The Math:
- **6 NFTs sold** = Break even ($16.58 revenue)
- **10 NFTs sold** = $26.28 profit + fuel for 28 more NFTs
- **Scale infinitely** using your own profits

This approach lets you **prove the concept** and **build revenue** before making any significant investment!
