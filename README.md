# DreamMint DApp

DreamMint is a decentralized application (DApp) for capturing, visualizing, and collecting dreams as NFTs. Users can record, write, or describe their dreams and mint them as unique, personal NFTs. The project uses React, Vite, TypeScript, and will integrate smart contracts (ERC-721), IPFS storage, and AI features.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (to be added)
- Blockchain: Solidity (ERC-721, to be added)
- Storage: IPFS/NFT.Storage (to be added)
- AI Integration: OpenAI/Stable Diffusion (future)

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Next Steps
- Add Tailwind CSS for styling
- Scaffold smart contract with Hardhat
- Integrate ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- Set up IPFS/NFT.Storage for dream content
- Build dream input and minting UI

## Smart Contracts
- contracts/DreamMint.sol: DreamMint ERC-721 contract for minting dream NFTs
